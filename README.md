ContactManager
==============
To start application:

1. "ContactManager" folder has my project related files.
2. ContactManager.java has the main method.
3.  I have complied all the classes already. 
4. "java ContactManager" command would start my application

=====================================================================

IMPORTANT if compilation is done again:

1. The txt file which holds the data is "sampleData.txt".
2. In the Service.java class, I have given path to the file (local path of my PC)
3. Please change the path of the file in Service.java class if comiling again.
4. If this is not done, the application simply throws an error message on the screen

=====================================================================

Note on Delete Action:

For deleting a record, the user has to click on the record in the table or delete button again even if 
he/ she is in the delete mode.

This avoid accidental deletion of the record.

=====================================================================
Things I thought of adding but could not:

I could not add red color to the border of the textfield (FirstName, Last Name and Initial) to indicate
that the name already exits. That would be more user friendly.
